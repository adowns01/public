Remote Coaching
==

#### Beginning of the session
Usually students want to hear a little about you in the beginning of the session, they tend to want to hear that you are doing well in the job market. If they dont ask about your background or anything else, give yourself a very quick intro, making sure you mention that you are a DBC grad (being remote for some reason seems to imply you are not...).

Go over what the student requested, ask how they expect their ideal session would work. Usually they want to work through an example they were working on or start from scratch. Sometimes they just want to be able to ask questions and see small examples.


#### What to do during the session
If you are screen-sharing, do not take control of the keyboard unless you clearly indicate it, lag can make things difficult/frustrating/awkward. For small corrections like syntax, just wait until they finish the bit of code they want and correct it after, no need to stop the flow of the session (they will notice and either accept/understand what you did or ask why you did it).

Don't forget you're not next to them, I don't know how many times I would catch myself halfway through an explanation realizing that pointing at the screen helps no one. If you are used to coaching in person, get used to **only** highlighting and switching windows and not using your hands. If the connection is not good or your are not using something like screenhero, note the line numbers.

Constantly stop and ask if they understand everything, and if you suspect otherwise, ask them to explain it. If all the work is on one page, highlight it for them. Otherwise, guide them through if they are struggling by switching the tabs for them (let them focus on explaining and not navigating).

If a student is stuck on a part and you do not have the answer, you can look on your own computer for the answer so long as you let them know while they are still thinking about the problem. If you are driving and have the question or want to guide them through a search, they will do it on their computer.

#### At the end of the session
With a remote session they tend to be overly grateful that you took the time to pair with them (they think it's more of an inconvenience being remote), make sure to assure them that it's no problem for them to ask you for help.

Ask them if they covered everything they wanted and ask one more time if there was any section they still weren't clear on, places you jumped over or moved too fast through, or any new questions that they may have.

Don't forget to ask for feedback!

#### Tools
- Screenhero
- Skype
- Google Hangouts
- Phone + Skype/Google Hangouts/Collabedit

The number one tool I have used is by far ScreenHero, sharing the screen is much more important than seeing each other (this isn't always preferred by the student but is rare and they tend to let you know). If connection is a problem, then a separate phone call is preferred with the other services just because the phone call will be more reliable and if the video gets choppy/laggy you can still be in communication. If the student is at DBC, then 90% their connection will be adequate, just make sure you have a good connection as well.

### How do I ask coaches for help?

Using the help request, er, bat signal form!

### I’ve submitted a help request form but haven't heard back!

Hey, we hear you, we were once students too, remember!

As much as we love coming to DBC, we have jobs and lives outside of DBC, and coach at DBC when we have extra time and energy.  We’d love to respond to every request but have found it an unreasonable expectation. 

The help request form isn't really a help request form, it's a beacon for help like a bat signal that lets us know when students need help as a cohort.  When we see lots of requests coming in, we come in more often.

And you know we still love you, of course!

### Who are DBC coaches?

Coaches are graduates who have demonstrated exceptionally strong technical and/or cultural alignment with Dev Bootcamp. 

### What do you do?

Most often when we’re at DBC we’re floating around helping individuals or small groups. We love to do breakout talks with students based on topics students want to hear about.  Ask us to organize one. We also run student hackathons every few cohorts to engage and inspire you beyond the normal DBC curriculum.

### Do we get paid for our time?

Yes, absolutely. Never feel guilty for asking for help, that’s the only reason we’re here. 

### How do you I find out who coaches are?

Great question. You can check out current active coaches in socrates

### If I can’t find a coach/can’t get help what should I do?

Ask the amazing people around you.  DBC is a community for learning, and the Boots in your cohort and those above and below you are your most valuable asset.  Remember that teaching is the best way to cement learning, so when you ask someone for help you’re making them better programmers as well.

### Do you have real jobs? And if so what are they?

Yes. The majority of coaches are employed full-time as developers at various companies and positions.  Ask us about our interests and experiences! Our schedules and commutes vary widely, so you’ll notice some coaches may come in only on weeknights, others on weekends.

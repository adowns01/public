- We’re happy to do mock assessments, etc!

### How do we start a conversation about ideas with coaches?

Feel free to fill out the beacon request form. And make sure to leave your email so we can reply back to you! 

We’re open to feedback, suggestions, and criticism.

### Are we interested in giving feedback to current curriculum?

Yes.  We can help develop and review curriculum as you write it.

We can also give feedback on patterns we observe in student progress.  Please remember that our sessions with students are confidential, and we will not talk to you about individual students without explicit consent. 

### I have feedback to give the coaches.

That is not a question but it is super awesome.  Feel free to shoot us an email saying how much you love us! Or even how you wish we would come in more often, or stop saying how great three.js is.
